## üêõ Known Limitations/ Bugs / Issues

1. **Server Downtime**  
   The backend server may be temporarily unavailable due to usage limits on the free trial version of the Render hosting platform.

2. **Limited Product Search**  
   Search functionality currently supports limited text matching, as product data is still being revised and improved.

3. **Missing Product Images**  
   Some product images may not load because external image support from Unsplash has been revoked or restricted. 

üîç **Please refer to the **Issues**[https://github.com/mohitgadhavi1/shopbot/issues](https://github.com/mohitgadhavi1/shopbot/issues) section of this project for an up-to-date list of known bugs, enhancements, and feature requests.

If you see DisallowedHost, update ALLOWED_HOSTS in Django settings.

If Vercel shows 401 Unauthorized, ensure JWT token is being passed correctly in headers.

üßæ Deployment
